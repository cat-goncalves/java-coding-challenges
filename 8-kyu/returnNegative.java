 * Return Negative

 * 
    In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

    Examples

    Kata.makeNegative(1);  // return -1
    Kata.makeNegative(-5); // return -5
    Kata.makeNegative(0);  // return 0
    Notes

    The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
    Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
